# Fraud_Transactions_Data_Pipline
#### Samsung Innovation Campus Final project

In this project, We designed and implemented a robust data pipeline that integrates data from multiple sources (relational databases, CSV files, and real-time streams) into a unified, structured Hive table on HDFS. The data pipeline ingests transactional data, which is further analyzed using Hive queries and visualized through a Power BI dashboard. Additionally, We developed machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions, showcasing the power of big data analytics and AI in addressing real-world business challenges.
